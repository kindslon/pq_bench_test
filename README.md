## pq_bench_test

This is the implementation of R&D assignment, benchmarking a set of queries against a hypertable containing series of CPU usage data.

To build, run `make` in the directory containing `pq_bench_test.cpp` and `Makefile`.

It is assumed that you have the environment setup as described in the assignment description.

Run `./pq_bench_test -h` to see the usage.
